This is a library for making SVG files easily through Haskell functions.
To install the library, you have to do

1. cabal configure
2. cabal build
3. cabal install --prefix=$HOME --user

and then use the library HSVG as any other Haskell library.

Some sample files are given in the folder "sample" to see how to use the library after installation.

Enjoy.
